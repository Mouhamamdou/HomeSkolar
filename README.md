# HomeSkolar (Design Phase)

## Project Overview

HomeSkolar is a conceptual web application designed to connect students in need of academic support with remote volunteer tutors. This project is currently in the design phase, and its primary goal is to outline the vision and requirements for the future development of the application.

## Design Goals

- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the platform is user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, including those with specific needs.

- **User Experience:** Focusing on creating an intuitive and enjoyable experience for both students and volunteer tutors.

- **Functionality:** Defining the core features and functionality of the application, including authentication, messaging, student-tutor meetings, and task management.

## Technologies Considered

- **Front-end:** Vue.js is being considered for a responsive user interface.

- **Back-end:** Python with Django is a potential choice for the backend development.

- **Database:** A relational database (e.g., MySQL) is under consideration for storing and retrieving data.

- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are being explored for secure authentication.

- **Real-time Messaging:** WebSocket is a potential option for asynchronous real-time communication.
